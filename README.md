# Template Finite State Machine (FSM) Library

## Overview
This repository provides a Java-based implementation of a **Template Finite State Machine (FSM)**. It serves as a lightweight and flexible library for defining and managing **Finite State Machines** or **Workflow Engines**. The library enables developers to model complex state transitions, enforce business rules, and implement structured workflows with ease.

## Features
- **Flexible State Transitions** â€“ Define states and transitions dynamically.
- **Event-Driven Execution** â€“ Trigger transitions based on events.
- **Customizable State Behaviors** â€“ Attach actions to state transitions.
- **Thread-Safe Design** â€“ Ensures concurrency safety for multi-threaded environments.
- **Logging and Debugging Support** â€“ Track state changes and transitions.
- **Lightweight and Efficient** â€“ Minimal dependencies for easy integration.

## Installation
Since this library is not yet available as a Maven dependency, you need to clone the repository and build the JAR file manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robofox96/simple-fsm.git
cd simple-fsm
mvn clean install
```

Then, manually include the generated JAR file in your project.
